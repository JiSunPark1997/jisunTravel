						<p class="fh5co-lead animate-box"><strong>Osaka(大阪市, Ōsaka-shi)</strong> is second largest
            metropolitan area after Tokyo. It does not have many tourism resources comparing to Kyoto and Nara, but it has many
          historical sites, such as Osaka Catle and Shotoku (oldest temple in Japan).
        <br />
        <br />
      <strong>Kyoto(京都, Kyōto)</strong> served as Japan's capital and the emperor's residence from 794 until 1868.
    It has many beautiful classical Buddhist temples, imperial palaces, and traditional wooden houses.</p>

            <p class="explain">Osaka Castle (大阪城, Ōsakajō) is one of the famous landmarks and it played
            a major role in the unification of Japan during the sixteenth century of the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568-1600).
          I went to Japan during summer which was very humid and hot. There is no direct transit to Osaka Catsle so I had to
        walk for 30 minutes while sweating. However, the beauty of the design of Osaka Catsle made me forget about tiredness and humidness.
      They sold ice cream and snacks right next to the catsle, and many people were performing in front of the catsle.
    I could not go into the catsle, but I recommend to get a ticket and go in.</p>

            <p class="explain">Gyukatsu (picture on the right) is one of my favorite foods in Osaka. It looks like rare Katsu, but they give you a small
            hot stone so you can grill as much as you want. I had to wait for an hour to eat. But the line was worth it to wait. If I could go to Osaka in the future, I will definitely visit this place.
          <br />Japanese ramen is the most famous food you must eat whilte traveling Japan. The resturant called "Ichiran Ramen" is one of the most famous
        ramen palces in Osaka. I had to wait in line almsot for an hour at 11PM. You first pick the sauce, and pick toppings. It was little salty, but overall, it was really delicious.
      While I was waiting for ramen, I bought Takoyaki, which is a ball-shaped made of a wheat flour filled with diced octopus. It was much softer than what I ate before in US or Korea.
    The size was really big so it might be too heavy for snacks.   </p>

            <p class="explain">I went to Hanku Department Store, and bought a piece of roll cake filled with milk cream inside.
              The bread was really soft. It looks like there is too much cream, but the cream was not cheesy nor overly sweet.
              It tastes exactly like milk. If it does not have a short expired date, I would buy a full roll cake and bring it to my home.
              After 2 days traveling in Osaka, I went to Kyoto by taking train.

            <p class="explain"> While Osaka is more like city, Kyoto is more like traditional Japanese town. It had many tempels and old wooden houses.
              I really liked this town becuase I could really feel Japanese life. Their sushi was the best. I cannot even compare to sushu in US or Korea.
              One of my favorite sushu was Uni. It costs little more expensive than other sushu, but it is worth it to try it.

          <p class="explain">Okonomoyaki was not my type, but it was unique. It taste like pencake that contains many other ingredients.
            I really did not like it because I don't like eating many ingredients at once, but it will be good to try it.

        <p class="explain">Overall, Japan was really clean, quiet, and charming place. People were really nice and polite.
        My favorite part was their food. All the Japanese foods were so delicious and unforgettable.
      Japan is the place I would definately visit once more.</p>
